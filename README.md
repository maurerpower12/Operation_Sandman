This mini project was created to demonstrate my passion for baseball and product design. Utilizing Unity and C#, this game demonstrates several key skills I've learned over the years. The most important of which is creating clean and self documenting code that is easy to understand. This mini-game is a throw back to the old MVP Baseball games of 2004 or 2005 where there would be pitching mini challenges that would test your ability to throw strickes in pressure situations.

Skills used to make this game:
* Game play scripting (i.e. sound controller, game controllers, etc)
* Coroutines
* Memory management (Instantiating & Destroy)
* Event Handlers
* Materials, Animations, Textures
* Force Vectors (Add Force & Add Torque)

## How To Play
* Use a mouse cursor to aim the ball's release point.
* Left click fire the baseball.
* Repeat ⚾️

## Technical Details
* Built with Unity 2021.3.1f1
* Made for WebGL
* Dependencies: Text Mesh Pro
