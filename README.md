This mini project was created to demonstrate my passion for baseball and product design. Utilizing Unity and C#, this game demonstrates several key skills I've learned over the years. The most important of which is creating clean and self documenting code that is easy to understand. This mini-game is a throw back to the old [MVP Baseball games of 2005](https://www.ign.com/wikis/mvp-baseball-2005/Mini_Games) where there would be pitching mini challenges that would test your ability to throw strickes in pressure situations.

Skills used to make this game:
* Game play scripting (i.e. sound controller, game controllers, etc)
* Coroutines
* Memory management (Instantiating & Destroy)
* Event Handlers
* Materials, Animations, Textures
* Linear and Quadratic Bezier Curves

## How To Play
* Select a pitch type from the dropdown on the right.
* Use a mouse cursor to aim the ball.
* Left click fire the baseball.
* Repeat ⚾️
